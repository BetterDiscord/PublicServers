On the left hand side is the main navigation. Here, you can search using any keywords, or browse through a number of existing categories including things like "Popular" and "Featured". You can even browse through all servers listed!

On the right is where the listing of matching servers will go. They are broken up into pages about 20 on each page. The page navigation and indicator will be at both the top and bottom of the right hand side.

At the top you can click `Connect` to connect your account. This allows you to directly join different servers directly inside Discord!
